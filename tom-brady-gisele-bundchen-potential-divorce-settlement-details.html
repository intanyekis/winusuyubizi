Even though the long-time couple haven’t confirmed or denied if they’re separating, <a href=#>sources claim they’ve both hired divorce attorneys</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The alleged split comes after over a decade of marriage and two children together. Given that they seemed like a solid couple for years, Tom and Gisele’s divorce news has taken fans by surprise. The public is curious to know what contributed to their break-up and if it’s final. Here’s everything we know about Tom and Gisele’s divorce (so far).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Sylvester Stallone And Jennifer Flavin Get Back Together?</a></span></p><h2 id=gisele-wouldn-rsquo-t-support-tom-rsquo-s-football-career-anymore>Gisele Wouldn’t Support Tom’s Football Career Anymore</h2><p>Tom’s return to the NFL seems to be the main source of contention between him and Gisele. In February, the quarterback announced he was retiring from football after 22 seasons. Shortly after, he signed a $375 million deal with Fox Sports to take on the role of lead NFL analyst.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it was only weeks later that Tom announced he was un-retiring and joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for another season.</p><p>Immediately, reports said that Tom didn’t consult his wife in his decision, as that she was upset by his decision to return to the NFL, as she was hoping he’d have more time to spend on his family during retirement.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Johnny Depp’s Relationship With His Attorney, Joelle Rich</a></span></p><p>In September, a source described Gisele as “frustrated” over the situation. "Going back to Tampa after the retirement put a strain on the personal side of his life," the source told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>. "Gisele is frustrated and sick of his career coming before their family, who has always supported him."</p><p>Gisele later echoed this sentiment herself in an interview with <a href=#>ELLE</a> where she said she was no longer willing to put her career on the back burner to prioritize Tom’s career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’ve done my part, which is [to] be there,” the model said. “I moved to Boston, and I focused on creating a cocoon and a loving environment for my children to grow up in and to be there supporting him and his dreams.”</p><h2 id=tom-amp-gisele-rsquo-s-relationship-problems-are-nothing-new>Tom & Gisele’s Relationship Problems Are Nothing New</h2><p>Tom’s decision to unretire seems to be the catalyst for his and Gisele’s divorce, but reports say that relationship problems are nothing new for the pair. One source said, "<a href=#>[The problems] are 10 years</a> old. This has been going on forever. This is nothing new to either of them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom and Gisele have only been married for little over a decade, having tied the knot in 2009. But their relationship got off to a rocky start when it was revealed Tom was expecting a baby with his ex, Bridget Moynahan, shortly after he started dating Gisele in 2006. Bridget gave birth to their son, John, the following year, while Gisele and Tom welcomed their first child together in 2009.</p><p>Gisele hinted that her issues with Tom have been ongoing in her interview with Elle, explaining, “Obviously, I have my concerns — this is a very violent sport, and I have my children and I would like him to be more present. I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again. But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too.”</p><h2 id=the-divorce-could-get-messy-despite-a-prenup-in-place>The Divorce Could Get Messy, Despite A Prenup In Place</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was reported last month that Tom and Gisele were attempting to save their marriage. “<a href=#>They’re working through things</a> and trying to come out the other side,” an insider explained, adding Tom is “doing everything he can to make it up to” his wife.</p><p>However, it’s since been alleged that the pair have hired lawyers. Reports say Gisele was the one to initiate the divorce, and though Tom is hurt, he’s concerned about protecting his assets.</p><p>" <a href=#>It's pretty obvious that he's hurting</a> . He feels very hurt by her,” a source said. “She is the one steering the divorce. She is playing offence and he is playing defence. He wants to protect himself, protect his interests, but he's only starting to go the legal route in his defence from her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things have the potential to get messy, especially considering Gisele allegedly wanted to renegotiate their prenup recently. Following Tom’s record-breaking deal with Fox Sports, sources said that Gisele’s loved ones were encouraging her to revisit their prenup.</p><p>“<a href=#>Gisele is rich in her own right</a>,” a source said. “But her friends are telling her she’d be nuts not to revise their prenup and she’s likely to listen to them.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Wildest Things Kanye West Has Done Since His Divorce From Kim K</a></span></p><p>“The current prenup is pretty ironclad and lists how everything will be divided should they break up, but it needs to be updated and it can be if both parties agree,” the insider added.</p><p>There’s also speculation that Tom and Gisele may argue over custody of their kids – Benjamin, 12, and Vivian, 9. Tom lives mainly in Tampa where he trains in his team, while Gisele is based in Miami.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While custody remains to be seen, one source said that Gisele doesn’t believe it will be an issue. <a href=#>"[She] feels bad for the kids</a> , but she doesn't expect any custody issues,” they explained.</p><p>They added that Tom has a great relationship with his children, "The kids love Tom. He is a great dad. She [Gisele] feels bad for the kids."</p><p>While Gisele has been noticeably absent from Tom’s games this season, their children have been spotted watching from the sidelines. So, while Gisele may no longer want to support Tom’s career, it appears she’s not standing in the way of their kids being there for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdl7%2BisNhmnqKrlaGybq7Up5ucoJWjerG7056lraGRoXqltdWoqZydXaiytcDLnqSepqRisabAwKKjrGc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kanye-west-and-wife-bianca-censori-banned-by-venice-boat-company-after-controversial-photos.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kanye West And 'Wife' Bianca Censori Banned By Venice Boat Company After Controversial Photos</a>
