A rapper who blends hip hop, rock, and rap. Only a true artist, and dare we say, a genius, can break records set by legends such as The Beatles and Michael Jackson. Post Malone did these while in his early twenties.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry Potter: 10 Richest Actors Who Played Hogwarts Students, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>He's still got at least 40 years of music in him, and we can't wait to witness his career grow and transform as he gains popularity and riches. Speaking of riches, Celebrity Net Worth reports his value at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$14 million</a>. We can only speculate all he's done with his always-tired, hard-earned cash. But we know at least ten things he spent some of that money on, and here they are.</p><h2 id=1968-chevrolet-truck>1968 Chevrolet Truck</h2><p>The musician certainly has an eye for vintage cars and in this case vintage pick-ups. The truck that's with Post Malone in this image is a 1968 Chevrolet C10, a rare hybrid of muscle car and truck. This car fits the rapper well, having a two-door cab and a large storage area out back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Craziest Things Post Malone Has Ever Bought</a></span></p><p>This Chevy C10, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>, has a distinct low-ride suspension and is powered by a 6-liter V8 engine and was sold to him by DT Auto Brokers in Salt Lake City for $50,000. Just like he said in one of his most popular songs, he's dolla’ ridin' in an old school Chevy, but this is just a taste of the rides Post Malone has in his garage.</p><h2 id=a-french-car>A French&nbsp;Car</h2><p>An American <a href=#>rapper</a> musician who blew up in the music industry would have money to spend on more than just American cars. Post Malone didn’t waste any time getting himself a French supercar for $3 million large according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Drive</i></a>. The European supercar was a white Bugatti Chiron, a vehicle that's just too irresistible for a celebrity who can afford it, let alone a car enthusiast millionaire. The Chiron is the fastest production car in Bugatti's garage, going from zero to 400 mph in a record 42 seconds. His love for American cars is still irreplaceable as we also learned that he has a Lincoln Continental in his garage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-mille-watch>Richard Mille Watch</h2><p>The RM 052 Tourbillon Skull model of <a href=#>Richard Mille</a> is one of a kind, on the face of the watch is a skull. The skull watch is a symbol of nonconformity that just fits the personality of Post Malone. We know him to be a fan of skulls, having them inked on at least four parts of his tattoo-riddled body, but this particular skull is one classy skull. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a> reports that the Richard Mille RM 052 Tourbillon Skull watch costs half a million dollars, a wristwatch that's probably more expensive than any property we've ever bought. Post Malone is simply just making his dreams come true, who can resist Swiss timepieces after getting a taste of European cars?</p><h2 id=a-bentley-for-charity>A Bentley For Charity</h2><p>Post Malone does some charity work aside from his sold-out concerts and multi-platinum albums. In this particular situation, the beneficiary was Folds of Honor. Folds of Honor is a charitable organization that supports military families, and Post Malone helped amp donations by raffling off a 2018 Bentley Continental GT to a lucky person who donated to the charity. The car is worth at least $300,000 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>People</i></a> stated that Posty did more than announce the free vehicle. He also went undercover to urge people to make a donation to Folds of Honor. The winner also got a free tour in Los Angeles with Post Malone accompanying them, maybe acting as chauffeur and tour guide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=50k-to-fans>50K To Fans</h2><p>E11even in Miami is a nightclub located in downtown that parties 24/7. A premier venue for events, E11even boasts a lineup of performers such as 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and the top DJs in the land. Post Malone visited <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami</a> and later it suddenly rained money in the club. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Daily Mail</i></a> has the story and they said that Post Malone came in with a water cooler filled with $1 bills.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Harry Potter: 10 Richest Actors Who Played Hogwarts Professors, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>He shared the money rockstar-style with the people in the club, throwing stacks of bills up in the air and filling the pockets of the crowd with dollar bills. The cash he let rain was worth $50,000, a generous, purely-for-fun gesture from the Billboard Music Awards multiple winner.</p><h2 id=an-italian-car>An Italian Car</h2><p>From godfathers to the omerta code, the Italians are popular not only for their pasta but also for fast cars. Lamborghini is an Italian luxury car company that produced the 350 GT. What Post Malone bought was actually a Lamborghini Aventador SV. The luxury <a href=#>sports car</a>'s base price is about $500,000, and the rapper’s was a white custom-built one. This car has a top speed of 217 miles per hour and hits 60 in just 2.8 seconds. Post Malone's song “Wow” has lyrics something along the line of driving a 750 Lambo in the Utah snow. It just goes to show how much the man loves his Lamborghinis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chicken-and-gators>Chicken And Gators</h2><p>Post Malone not only collaborates with other musicians, he also collaborates with shoe companies. His latest collaboration with Crocs is called Crocs Duet Max Clog Post Malone and he gave some of them away at a Chicken Express in South Lake, Texas. Once upon a time, Posty worked at a Chicken Express so that he could buy himself a pair of Versace shoes. Now that it's time to pay it forward, this collaboration with Crocs is giving the chicken restaurant's employees and customers free Crocs. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>CBS News</i></a> reported that Post Malone wasn't actually at the event, but fans still came. The new Crocs Duet Max Clog Post Malone was priced at $59.99 but it got sold out only hours after it was released.</p><h2 id=the-old-rolls-royce-and-the-new-one>The Old Rolls Royce And The New One</h2><p>He may have had some bad luck with this British-made car but Post Malone didn't think twice buying a second one after an accident. His first one was a Rolls Royce Wraith, a great car in global standards and Rolls Royce claims it to be the most powerful and dynamic car in its history. The Wraith is priced at least $320,000 so when this one got wrecked Posty bought a new Rolls Royce, an upgrade as well, a Phantom this time. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>TMZ</i></a> reports this model is priced at $420,000. Post Malone is practically daring any Kia owner out there to try and wreck his new baby, or maybe just check his new baby out, peace!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-home-in-salt-lake-city>A Home In Salt Lake City</h2><p>Post Malone drops his most expensive purchase so far on a property in Utah. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>E Online</i></a>, it's a 12,072 square foot estate, up in a secluded spot in the mountains. It's a perfect resting spot for the busy musician. The property is not just a place for him to set up a big screen and play video games all day long, it also has a lot of other facilities. A pool, a basketball court, a wine cellar, and an outdoor kitchen. He can also play host to some friends as the house comes with five bedrooms and six baths. Only thing missing here is a studio for him to work on his follow-up to <i>Hollywood's Bleeding</i>.</p><h2 id=hennessey-velociraptor>Hennessey Velociraptor</h2><p>The last item in the list is our favorite of all the cars of the multi-award winning artist. The Hennessey Velociraptor is beauty meets beast. It's an elegant 6-wheel pick-up truck that's priced at least $349,000. The Hennessey upgrade and modifications are too much for Post Malone to ignore, he got a white one and it's definitely the ride that best fits him, if you ask us. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Robb Report</i></a>, DJ Marshmello has the same ride and it's only a matter of time, and some well-positioned nudges before we find out which Hennessey Velociraptor eats the dust of the other. You know whose 6x6 we'll be rooting for!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Richest Late Night Talk Show Hosts, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8%2Boqq1lnZa5sLrEZqWerF2svLPAx2akqKaVrnqxwdGcn5qrlah8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-10-strangest-and-most-expensive-implants-of-hip-hop-artists-ever.html>&#171;&nbsp;The 10 Strangest And Most Expensive Implants Of Hip-Hop Artists Ever</a>
