In fairness, they have been dating for around six years now, and she is super famous. He isn't just arm candy, though. The 31 year old is also an actor and a model. His big break came in Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, but prior to that he had been acting in theaters in London for a few years. Other movies including, but not limited to, Boy Erased, Mary Queen of Scot, and Catherine Called Birdy.<span class=related-single>Related:<a class=bc-title-link href=# title="10 Lesser-Known Facts About Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Relationship">10 Lesser-Known Facts About Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Relationship</a></span>Alwyn has also done modeling. He posed with Gigi Hadid in Vogue, starred in a Prada campaign. Some people speculate that the 2016 shoot with Gigi is where the Taylor connect comes in. Gigi Hadid and <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> have been best friends for years now, so maybe that's how the two met? Joe lives a very private life, as does Taylor for the most part, so we may never know. Aside from being on the arm of Ms. Swift, Joe can hold his own in a photo. Keep reading on to see some of his best looks, with and without the beautiful Taylor Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-lynn-s-long-halftime-walk-2017><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk | 2017</span></h2><p>Joe Alwyn was sporting a perfectly messy hair look in 2017, for his leading role in Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Joe had never stepped in front of a camera before auditioning for this role.</a> This movie was one of the first to use the 120 frames-per-second format. Since Joe had no experience either way, it wasn't as hard to adapt as it may have been for others. To see the movie, you would never know it was his first film.</p><h2 id=prada-campaign-2018><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Prada Campaign | 2018</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the spring of 2018, Joe Alwyn was the face of the Ascension Prada Campaign. Following in the footsteps of celebrities like Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro, this was a huge deal for Joe at the time, considering he wasn't quite as famous as the aforementioned actors. His Prada look is very prestigious, another job well done. With combed back locks and a slight stuble, Joe looks like an old pro.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a class=bc-title-link href=# title="Joe Alwyn Reveals Why He Kept It A Secret That He Co-Wrote Taylor Swift Songs">Joe Alwyn Reveals Why He Kept It A Secret That He Co-Wrote Taylor Swift Songs</a></span></p><h2 id=conversations-with-friends><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Conversations With Friends</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Convos on Hulu is a Sally Rooney adaptation based on a complicated relationship between two different couples who wind up coming together as friends. It gets a little heavy from that point on when Nick (Alwyn) who is married starts falling for another woman. Tune in to Hulu to see his performance for yourself. He is seen in this series with a beard and goatee.</p><h2 id=the-favourite><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>THE FAVOURITE</span></h2><p>Oscar winning movie, The Favourite, directed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yorgos Lanthimos</a> co-stars Joe Alwyn. He has a few different looks in the movie, certainly some you need to see to believe. Like the large powdered wig and having his face made up in 18th century themed pale white make-up. Joe does an excellent job in this movie with all versions of his character.</p><h2 id=mary-queen-of-scots><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mary Queen Of Scots</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This movie is based loosely around the reign of Mary Queen of Scots and the relationship she had with her cousin Queen Elizabeth I. Here we see Joe Alwyn playing Sir Robert Dudley/Earl of Leicester who is Elizabeth's lover. While it's not a huge part of the movie, it serves an important purpose in the overall history between the cousins. And we get to see Joe dressed in proper 16th century timepieces.</p><h2 id=tom-ford-beau-de-jour-campaign><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tom Ford Beau de Jour campaign</span></h2><p>The then 29-year-old British celebrity becomes the face of Tom Ford's fragrance campaign; Beau de Jour. He is featured in a black-and-white print imagery campaign for the travel retail industry. Sold in airports and duty-free shops internationally. The video shows Joe as a remarkably handsome well-dressed gentleman. Definitely Taylor approved. The campaign was an instant success, with the images going viral and being featured on many websites and social media platforms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cannes-film-festival><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cannes Film Festival</span></h2><p>Joe attended the Cannes Film Festival together with his co-star Margaret Qualley, who was dressed in Chanel Couture. Their movie, The Stars At Noon, had its world premiere there, and Joe arrived dressed in Celine fashion. He was capturing the kind of rockabilly appearance that many young actors have recently become fond of, in a way that was both rebellious and fantastically stylish.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a class=bc-title-link href=# title="How Jemima Kirke Really Felt Playing Joe Alwyn's Wife In 'Conversations With Friends' ">How Jemima Kirke Really Felt Playing Joe Alwyn's Wife In 'Conversations With Friends'</a></span></p><h2 id=oscars-2019><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Oscars | 2019</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Again, without Taylor, Joe strolled the red carpet. He instead arrived alongside co-star Nicholas Hoult. Joe received a nomination for his work in "The Favourite." With his hair softly flipped to the side, he looked really handsome. In black velour from Tom Ford and square-toed black boots, he added a little spice to the ensemble.</p><h2 id=miss-americana><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Miss Americana</span></h2><p>If you missed it, Miss Americana is a Netflix documentary by T Swift. Of course, we love her, but it gets even better when after a performance she runs off the stage and throws herself into Joe's arms. They rarely make public appearances, so we will take what we can get. This is officially the best look on Joe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwZqyfpXqtu86kqmanlmLBosXLqKlmq6ees7W%2FjKygoKaZm7akrc2tZKismJq%2FbrbOnmSapKeuu3A%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./halle-bailey.html>&#171;&nbsp;Halle Bailey</a>
