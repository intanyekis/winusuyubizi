Portsmouth, Virginia, Missy Elliott had a musical childhood</a> since she was a part of the church choir in her hometown. After relocating and graduating high school, she created an all-female group to make music. Elliott ventured into a solo career at 25 when she was signed onto a record label to release her albums. While her debut album was a massive success, the sophomore became a bigger hit leading to multiple accolades and critical acclaim. <a href=#>Through her music and lyrics about gender equality</a> and representation, the rapper created her sound, which audiences fell in love with everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Missy Elliott has amassed a massive $50 million fortune over the years through her contribution to music, sold-out concerts, and brand endorsements. Her songs have become timeless as the new generation of listeners gravitates toward old-school rap. A career that got its beginnings in a choir let’s take a look at the success story of Missy Elliott.</p><h2 id=she-dared-to-dream>She Dared To Dream</h2><p>Melissa Arnette Elliott, better known as Missy Elliott, was born in Virginia and was the only child of Ronnie and Patricia Elliot. While her father actively worked in the Marine, Elliott moved a lot with her family from North Carolina to Florida. Due to the father’s abusive behavior, she relocated to Portsmouth, Virginia, at fourteen years of age for school. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, Elliot found interest in rapping from a young age and formed her group Sista in 1991. The female R&B group created demo tracks for submissions to various record labels to get a big break.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Cars In Missy Elliott's Garage</a></span></p><p>Simultaneously, she became friends with Timothy Mosley, who had been interested in DJing since he was a child. He took on the stage name of Timbaland and began creating beats for Sista. They collaborated on tracks together, and their produced track caught the interest of Elektra Records’ executive DeVante Swing who signed Elliott’s band to his record label. Along with producing music for other artists, Elliott’s Sista and Timbaland co-produced the LP <i>4 All the Sistas Around da World</i>, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>. They became a songwriting and producing team who collaborated with artists like 702 and Aaliyah. While working with her band, Elliott also began featuring on tracks for other rappers like Men of Vizion <a href=#>and Sean Diddy Combs</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=empowering-through-music>Empowering Through Music</h2><p>1996 gave a big milestone for Missy Elliott as she was granted her record label, The Goldmine Inc., which enabled her to work under Elektra but create, write and produce her songs.

She released her second album in 1997, <i>Da Real World</i>, which became a massive success, and her follow-up album <i>Miss E… So Addictive</i> won two Grammy Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a>, Elliott has been a champion of breaking barriers and an inspiration to women of color in a male-dominated rap industry. She created female-empowering music and an individual style of music when male rappers overshadowed her accomplishments. With her bold outfits and narratives in music videos, Elliott began a conversation about feminism long before it was mainstream. With hit songs like <i>Get Ur Freak On</i> and <i>Work It</i>, Elliott became the best-selling female rapper in the United States. Missy Elliott released three more studio albums, <i>Under Construction</i>, <i>This Is Not a Test!</i>, and <i>The Cookbook</i>.</p><h2 id=paving-the-way-for-future-female-rappers>Paving The Way For Future Female Rappers</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the release of her sixth album in 2006, Elliott has continued producing music for other artists like Monica and Jennifer Hudson.
