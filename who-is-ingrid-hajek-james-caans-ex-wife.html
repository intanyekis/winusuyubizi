She is an American model, life coach, social media influencer, television personality, and entrepreneur.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Ingrid Hajek’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Ingrid Hajek</li><li><strong>Gender: </strong>Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> January 6, 1960</li><li><strong>Ingrid Hajek’s Age:</strong> 63 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American-Puerto Rican</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Capricorn</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Ingrid Hajek’s ex-husband:</strong> James Caan</li><li><strong>Ingrid Hajek’s Children:</strong> Alexander James Caan</li><li><strong>Ingrid Hajek’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 6 inches</li><li><strong>Ingrid Hajek’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 167.64 cm</li><li><strong>Ingrid Hajek’s Weight:</strong> 56 kg</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the third wife of James Caan</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Ingrid Hajek?</strong></h2><p>Currently 63 years old, Ingrid Hajek was born on January 6, 1960, in Queens, New York City, USA. In addition to being born in the US, she is Puerto Rican. Hajek was raised in a Christian home by parents whose identities are yet to be disclosed. Her siblings, if any, are also not known, but she seems to have had a stable childhood and got the right education to set her career in motion.</p><p>According to details available on her LinkedIn, Hajek attended Coaches Institute, where she received the proper training to work as a Qualified Professional Life Coach and certified NLP. Details of her earlier educational background cannot be confirmed at this time.</p><h2><strong>She Became James Caan’s Wife in 1990</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/ingrid-hajek-family.jpg><p>James Caan and Ingrid Hajek were married from September 1990 to March 1994. Their wedding took place on September 9, 1990, on Regentsea, a boat in Marina Del Rey’s harbor. It was a private event attended by a few family members and friends who came to witness the union.</p><p>For Caan, it was his third marriage, and he was 49 years old at the time. Ingrid, on the other hand, was going into matrimony for the first time, and she was 29 years old.</p><p>The generational gap between the two did nothing to stop their love from growing. Just a year into the marriage, they welcomed their first and only child as a couple. Their son was named Alexander James Caan, and he was born in 1991. By the time their son was three years old, the marriage crashed.</p><h3><strong>James Caan was Already Famous When Ingrid Married Him</strong></h3><p>James Caan was active as an actor from 1960 until his death in 2022. Thus, he was already a star by the time he met and married Ingrid in 1990. His career breakthrough came with his performance as Sonny Corleone in Coppola’s The Godfather (1972). The role earned him Academy and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. He later reprised his role in The Godfather Part II (1974).</p><p>Other notable projects under his belt include Brian’s Song (1971), The Gambler (1974), Funny Lady (1975), Cinderella Liberty (1973), Rollerball (1975), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Comes a Horseman (1978), Chapter Two (1979), The Yards (2000), City of Ghosts (2002), Dogville (2003), Elf (2003), and Get Smart (2008).</p><p>With regard to his talent, Caan received many award recognitions in his lifetime, including an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards. He also bagged his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1978.</p><h3><strong>Why Did James Caan and Ingrid Hajek Get Divorced?</strong></h3><p>On March 29, 1994, Ingrid and James Caan went their separate ways, ending their marriage of barely four years. The reason for their divorce has remained undisclosed as the former couple has since moved on with their lives.</p><p>A 1994 interview with former Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss threw light on possible reasons the marriage between Ingrid and James ended. Speaking to Vanity Fair at the time, Fleiss claimed she was having an affair with James Caan in 1992, the same time he was still married to Ingrid Hajek. Her claims further revealed she visited the actor while he was working in Texas on the set of Flesh and Bones.</p><p>Responding to Heidi Fleiss’s interview, James Caan insisted that their relationship was only platonic with no strings attached. However, there is nothing to show if the said relationship had anything to do with his divorce from Ingrid.</p><p>After ending his marriage with Ingrid Hajek, Caan went ahead to marry Linda Stokes on October 7, 1995, and they had two sons. His union with Linda Stokes suffered the same fate as the previous three. The actor didn’t get married again until his death on July 6, 2022.</p><p>James Caan was 82 years old when he died in Los Angeles after getting admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for a heart attack. His death was caused by complications from coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure.</p><p>Caan was later buried at Eden Memorial Park Cemetery with tributes from fellow Hollywood stars like Robert Duvall, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino among others.</p><h2><strong>What Does James Caan’s Ex-wife Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Aside from being a former celebrity spouse, Ingrid Hajek has worked as a model, social media influencer, life coach, television personality, and businesswoman. The New York native is a professionally certified life coach and NLP practitioner, but before that, she was involved in modeling and did a great job in the industry.</p><p>Her beautiful features, which include brown hair and brown eyes, are part of the reason she excelled in the modeling industry. Ingrid has been featured in a few magazines as a model. She has also made a few appearances on television shows and programs.</p><p>According to her LinkedIn page, she has been a certified life coach since February 2006, and while her modeling days might be over as a result of age, she is most likely still active as a life coach. However, since her marriage to Caan ended, Ingrid has kept a low profile, avoiding any form of media attention. Thus, it is difficult to say what she has been up to lately.</p><h2><strong>Where is Ingrid Hajek Now?</strong></h2><p>Following the end of her celebrity spouse status, Ingrid went off the grid. Her absence from the celebrity circle made it difficult to keep tabs on her. She is also not active on social media, thus, there is little information available on her whereabouts.</p><p>If her <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> profile is anything to go by, Ingrid is currently working as a Life Coach at Life and Prosperity Coaching in Santa Monica, California, in the United States. Her area of specialization includes EFT practitioner, training in NLP, and the Kriya Yoga method of meditation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdnruovsidZKGZmpq4brbAppysZZOWrq%2B%2FjJ6vZq%2BZm7Jw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bello-sisters-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-26784-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bello Sisters Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a>
