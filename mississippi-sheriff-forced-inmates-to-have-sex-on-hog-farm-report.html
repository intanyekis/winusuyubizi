assaulted dozens of inmates and arrestees he dubbed “hookers,” “heifers” and “hos” during his three-decade career, according to an explosive new report.</p><p>Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott has been the subject of numerous sexual exploitation allegations since taking office in 2012, but continues to spearhead the department more than a decade later, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times revealed Wednesday.</a></p><p>Scott’s accusers claim the powerful law enforcement leader coerced them into a sexual relationship and retaliated against them when they threatened to come forward with the alleged abuse.</p><p>The alleged assaults date back to the years before Scott won his election for the leadership role, but one victim made allegations in the early months of his reign.</p><p>The unidentified 26-year-old woman accused Scott of driving her to a hog farm to have sex in his patrol car on at least five occasions in 2009 as part of a promise he would use his influence to keep her out of prison.</p><p>She laid out her claims in state circuit court just three months into Scott’s tenure and provided prison letters from the sheriff to them up, according to the report.</p><p>“Hey Sexy,” Scott, then 47, wrote to her in prison nine months before his election.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Clay County

Office/Facebook</span></figure><p>“Got my blood pumping hard after reading the last two letters. Can’t stop thinking of how tight it is. I want all of that and more if you can.”</p><p>A Clay County judge ruled against the woman and other officials failed to report the allegations to either state or federal law enforcement agencies.</p><p>There is also no record of any internal investigation or disciplinary review, and the court documents of the case when missing until reporters pressed for them during their investigation, the New York Times said.</p><p>The woman is among many who were allegedly victimized by Scott, but somehow evaded retaliation by his law enforcement team for attempting to come forward — a fate many other victims were unable to escape.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Scott allegedly ordered Deputy Kyle Eaves, second from left, to plant drugs in the car of a former victim. <span class=credit>Clay County Sheriff's Office/Facebook</span></figure><p>Amber Jones alleged that Scott repeatedly offered her eight-hour day passes to see her family during her eight-month prison stint in 2017 in exchange for sexual favors inside a storage unit on his private property.</p><p>“I felt like I was worthless, like I didn’t have any control over my own body,” she said. “There was nothing I could do to stop it,” the then-21-year-old recalled.</p><p>In the months after Jones was released from jail, she was pulled over by a narcotics officer from West Point, a town in Clay County, who discovered a bag of diabetic needles filled with meth under her passenger seat.</p><p>Jones denied owning the paraphernalia, telling the Times she knew she was “being set up” — an accusation that was later corroborated by a video recording that captured a local man with prior drug arrests admitting he planted the drugs inside the car on the orders of one of Scott’s officers.</p><p>The man said he was given the needles and dope by Deputy Kyle Eaves — who was named 2021 Deputy Sheriff of the Year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Facebook post shows.</a></p><p>One of Scott’s own former employees has formally accused the sheriff of sexual harassment in a federal lawsuit that is set for trial next year.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Scott has served as the Clay County Sheriff since 2012. <span class=credit>Google Maps</span></figure><p>Former investigative assistant&nbsp;Caitlyn Wilson — who claims Scott made sexual advances toward her and other coworkers and threatened to fire them after they rebuked him — said she had insider knowledge that her old boss sexually abused multiple inmates and arrestees.</p><p>She said he also sent inappropriate text messages to employees referring to women as “hookers,” “heifers” and “hos,” as well as suggested Wilson and another woman should “tag team” to give him oral sex.</p><p>After filing her complaint, Scott suspended and fired her then-boyfriend, a captain who had worked in the office for five years.</p><p>Scott denied the numerous allegations lodged against him, chalking them up to a “coordinated hit” to run him out of office.</p><p>He told the Times his accusers are “con artists” and “drug users” who were inventing accusations to avoid jail time or somehow benefit financially.</p><p>The Clay County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to The Post that Scott is still serving as the sheriff, but did not comment on whether he would face any renewed investigations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma2lfora0v8isqqKooJ56tLTEq6Cfnl2bvLOvxJ1koqadlsGmv4ytpmagkauybr%2FEsWSopl2dvKh5xZqppmWimr2wvtNo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./watch-the-postal-service-ben-gibbard-sing-such-great-heights-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Postal Services Ben Gibbard Dedicates Performance of Such Great Heights to the Postal S</a>
