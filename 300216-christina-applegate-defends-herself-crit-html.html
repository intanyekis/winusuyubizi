The actress has largely stayed out of the limelight after being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Ever since her diagnosis, Applegate has been working on her show, "Dead to Me," but she steered clear of award ceremonies.</p><p class=dh>The actress announced she would be attending the award show through a Twitter post in which she said she was looking forward to the ceremony. Applegate also noted that she was definitely feeling slightly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/1capplegate/status/1613595551983087616?s=20&t=T10KhIkFciSNm9AL5tNqBA">antsy</a> about attending since it's the first time she has gone to something as big as the CCAs since 2019.</p><p class=dh>True to her word, Applegate arrived at the CCAs, ready to make the most of the night. She looked breathtaking in an all-black suit, layered silver and diamond necklaces, and her trusty cane. The actress also had a surprising plus-one with her — her "rad" <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/1capplegate/status/1614822004833804290>daughter</a>, Sadie Grace LeNoble.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>After Applegate messaged the commenter about their response to the article, the user remained adamant that MS hadn't influenced the actress' appearance.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2c30f819b0f001109e32a6a859186a4e.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Sadie Grace LeNoble and Christina Applegate at at Fairmont Century Plaza on January 15, 2023 in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>It was the first time <a class="me a" href=#>Applegate</a> showed her daughter in public, and the mother-daughter-duo stepped onto the red carpet in complementary black suits and matching black Dr. Martens combat boots. Applegate took to Twitter following the award show, where she explained the Dr. Martens are some of the only shoes comfortable enough not to trigger her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/1capplegate/status/1615508849884299264>neuropathy</a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>How Did Applegate Bravely Defend Herself after the Award?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, individuals on the internet had derogatory commentary about Applegate's appearance after the award show. One commenter on an online article had a few things to say about Applegate's face, insinuating that the actress had gotten plastic surgery. Applegate decided to contact the internet user about their comments.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Applegate has been open and candid about her MS since 2021.</strong></h3><p class=dh>After Applegate messaged the commenter about their response to the article, the user remained adamant that MS hadn't influenced the actress' appearance. They even questioned whether it was genuinely Applegate speaking, claiming it wasn't the "Samantha Who?" star but a scammer. Applegate <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/1capplegate/status/1615395741249474565>responded</a> in a Twitter post:</p><p class=dh>"Sooooo I made the unfortunate decision to look at some comments on an article from people mag about me and my kids at the CCA.

She boldly announced that she had the disease when she turned 50. The actress wrote a Tweet that wished all her followers and fellow people with MS well. She said she knew many people were enduring a lot of pain. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/1capplegate/status/1464072336840085504>Tweeted</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Yup. I turned 50 today. And I have MS.

At the time, she was still filming "Dead to Me," which meant her symptoms often flared while she was on set. Finally, she was diagnosed, and she started speaking openly about it.</p><p class=dh>Nonetheless, Applegate was determined to finish filming her show, so she powered through the increasing symptoms. She went to work and did what she had to do to end the show, but she admitted that it was the hardest thing she had ever done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/46da8956794f034dde0933eff9d7256c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Lupita Sanchez Cornejo, David Faustino, Christina Applegate, Katey Sagal, Mitch O'Farrell, Linda Cardellini, and Liz Feldman on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on November 14, 2022 in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>As they approached the show's end, <a class="me a" href=#>Applegate</a> had to process the fact that she would be living with MS for the rest of her life.
