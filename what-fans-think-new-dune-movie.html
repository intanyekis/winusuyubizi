Dune was a 'near perfect recreation of the first half of maybe the most famous sci-if novel of all time,' another said, claiming 'Villeneuve is really a master of scale, scope, and sound.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The visuals in particuar stunned fans, managing to recreate the futuristic worlds with stylistic flair.
