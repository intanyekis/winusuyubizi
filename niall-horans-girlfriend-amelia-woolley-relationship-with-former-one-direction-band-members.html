During the conversation about blind dates, the singer admitted that he had been set up before, but he had never been on a blind date. When he was asked about his experience and who it was with, he revealed that's how he met his current girlfriend. However, there was a small misunderstanding on the talk show couch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/niall-horan-s-relationship-with-girlfriend-amelia-woolley-is-downright-mysterious-but-here-s-what-we-know-for-sur.jpg><p>When Horan was asked if the date went well, he said, "Kinda, it was kinda... it happened and then..." but before he could finish talking, fellow guest Prue Leith intervened, saying Woolley wouldn’t be happy when she saw that Horan said 'kinda girlfriend.'</p><p>Horan quickly corrected himself, asserting that Woolley was definitely his girlfriend and was backstage. Woolley and Horan have been spotted together in public a few times, such as when they went shopping in London in May 2021.</p><p><a href=#>The couple however made their first official public appearance together at Horan's Horan & Rose charity gala in September 2021</a>. Woolley posted a picture on Instagram of them standing next to each other at the event, using brown hearts and wilting rose emoji in the caption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>One Direction Fans Haven't Forgotten That Time Selena Gomez Was Caught With With Niall Horan</a></span></p><p>During the gala, Horan, along with professional golfer Justin Rose, contributed to raising over 800,000 Euros for charity, as reported by the Irish outlet Sunday World. Woolley and Horan also went to Mexico on a luxurious vacation in January 2022, where they were openly affectionate, and were captured in photos at the 2022 French Formula One Grand Prix. Wearing VIP lanyards, Horan and Wooley stood with Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes team, watching the exciting race from the sidelines.</p><h2 id=is-neil-horan-still-friends-with-other-former-one-direction-bandmates>Is Neil Horan Still Friends With Other Former One Direction Bandmates?</h2><p>Since their separation, the former bandmates have generally maintained a respectful attitude when discussing each other and their time in the band. Zayn Malik has been the most outspoken critic, having left One Direction in 2015 and expressing his frustrations about his experience in the group. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The other members don't seem to have much if any, contact with Malik.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/this-is-what-zayn-malik-was-really-doing-before-simon-cowell-put-him-in-one-direction-on-x-factor.jpg><p>However, the remaining four members have stayed in touch to varying degrees over the years. Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Horan are still good friends and communicate regularly, with Payne even referring to Tomlinson as his “best mate” in May 2022. Horan also mentioned that he and Tomlinson lived close to each other in Los Angeles and spent a lot of time together.</p><h2 id=does-amelia-woolley-relate-to-harry-styles>Does Amelia Woolley Relate To Harry Styles?</h2><p>While it is not certain Woolley has a relationship with Harry Styles, it is possible Woolley relates with Styles considering Horan and Styles still spend time together and have fun like they used to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Woolley was also spotted with Horan during his former One Direction bandmate Styles' headlining concert at Wembley Stadium in June 2022. Several fans shared videos of Horan enjoying Styles' solo songs and even singing along to the One Direction hit "What Makes You Beautiful."</p><p>Horan could be seen bobbing his head to the music while the camera captured the large crowd at Styles’ show. Horan and Woolley were seated in the same box as Styles’ family, and in another video, Horan is seen hugging Styles’ older sister, Gemma Styles, and dancing with a beer in hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/does-niall-horan-s-girlfriend-amelia-woolley-have-a-relationship-with-his-former-one-direction-bandmates_.jpg><p>This moment became a huge sensation on social media, as fans quickly noted that Horan had been the one who initially taught Harry to play the guitar, and now he was witnessing him perform in a sold-out arena.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Woolley was seen supporting Styles at his 2022 Wembley Stadium concert alongside Horan, it is not clear if she relates with the other bandmates. In an interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Horan shared that he and his former bandmates "speak constantly."</p><p>He also revealed that he shares some of his songs with his former bandmates for feedback before releasing them in a conversation with Esquire. Since Horan still has a relationship with the other members, it is quite possible Wooley also has a relationship with them, but there is not much proof of this.</p><h2 id=has-amelia-woolley-influenced-any-of-neil-horan-rsquo-s-songs>Has Amelia Woolley Influenced Any Of Neil Horan’s Songs?</h2><p>Woolley has certainly influenced Horan's music career since they started dating. In February 2023, Horan released a new song called "Heaven," which fans believe was inspired by his relationship with Woolley. The heartfelt lyrics seem to be dedicated to her. The song will be part of his upcoming album set to be released soon and will likely be performed during his upcoming tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/th-image-template-6.jpg><p>Horan also shared an amusing story about how Woolley inspired one of the songs on his new album. Woolley, like many women, is a big fan of true crime, and being a supportive boyfriend, Horan often watches these shows with her. This led to the creation of the track "You Could Start A Cult."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lizzo And Niall Horan's Relationship Explained</a></span></p><p>Horan explained that while watching one of these shows together, he had a funny thought, "You could start a cult, and I'd follow you into the fire." Although it started as a joke, the singer soon turned it into a masterpiece. He clarified that he wasn't suggesting Wolley could start a cult, but rather referring to the time they spend watching true-crime shows together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their public personas, Woolley and Horan have chosen to maintain a low profile and made a few appearances together. While there is limited information about Wooley’s relationship with Horan’s former One Direction bandmates, it is evident that he is deeply in love with her and their relationship seems to be going strong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilopmcoXqpu9Gapaxll56%2FrbLRopynnF2Wuqa4yJpksKefobmmxYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmr5mptW6yzquknqpdpLumecOiqZ6bpJ68r3nBmqWdZZ2auqOx0axm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./hayden-hurst-parents-meet-jerry-and-cathy-hurst.html>&#171;&nbsp;Hayden Hurst Parents: Meet Jerry and Cathy Hurst</a>
