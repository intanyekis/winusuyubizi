At her height, she has a body weight of 58 kg.</strong></p><p>Onlyjayus’ height goes well with her slim physique, which perfectly complements her looks. Judging by her height, she will easily make it to the list of tallest female YouTubers as her height is above the average height of American women. To a large extent, her height has become one of the numerous facts that fans wish to know about the social media star. Here is all that you need to know about how tall the YouTuber is.</p><h3><strong>OnlyJayus’s Biography Summary</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Name:&nbsp;</strong>Isabella Avila</li><li><strong>OnlyJayus’s Age:&nbsp;</strong>24 years old</li><li><strong>Birthday:&nbsp;</strong>April 12, 1999</li><li><strong>Birthplace:&nbsp;</strong>Central Valley, California, United States</li><li><strong>Birth Sign:&nbsp;</strong>Aries</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Height:&nbsp;</strong>5 feet 11 inches (180 m or 180 cm)</li><li><strong>Weight:&nbsp;</strong>58 kg</li><li><strong>Body Measurement:&nbsp;</strong>34 inches (bust), 28 inches (waist), and 40 inches (hips)</li><li><strong>Shoe Size:&nbsp;</strong>5.5 (US)</li><li><strong>Body Type: </strong>Slim Fit</li><li><strong>Hair Color: </strong>Blonde</li><li><strong>Eye Color:&nbsp;</strong>Dark Brown</li></ul><h2><strong>How Tall is OnlyJayus?</strong></h2><p>Standing 5 feet, 11 inches ( 1.80 m and 180 cm) tall, the YouTuber is one with a very obvious height. This is a rare height for females in America as statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2018 revealed that the average height of adult American women above 20 years old is 5 feet, 4 inches. This means that Onlyjayus’ stands 6 inches above an average adult American woman.</p><h3><strong>Onlyjayus’ Height Compared To Other YouTubers</strong></h3><p>Onlyjayus is taller than most of her fellow female social media stars. Among some of her co-American YouTubers that stand at a height below hers are Jenna Marbles – (5 feet 5½ inches), Liza Koshy (4 feet 9 inches), Lilly Singh (5 feet 5 inches), and Bethany Mota (5 feet 3 inches).</p><p>There are also some of Onlyjayus’ colleagues that stand at the same height with her and they include Danny Gonzalez (5 feet 11 inches) and PewDiePie (5 feet 11 inches) among others. However, we are yet to see other American female social media content creators who are taller than the 24-year-old.</p><h3><strong>How Tall is </strong><strong>Onlyjayus Compared to Sky Bri?</strong></h3><p>Sky Bri is a model and social media personality who stands at a significant height when compared to the stipulated height of adult females above 20 years old. She is reportedly 5 feet 8 inches, which is equivalent to 1.73 m or 173 cm.</p><p>This means that she and Onlyjayus are only a few inches apart in height with Sky Bri being the shorter one by 3 inches. However, their height difference is not quite noticeable when they stand side by side, thanks to high-heeled shoes.</p><h3><strong>Onlyjayus’s Stands</strong><strong>&nbsp;5 Inches Above Summer Mckeen</strong></h3><p>Summer Mckeen is a YouTuber born on May 12, 1999, in Eugene, Oregon, United States. She is 5 feet 6 inches tall (1.67 m or 167 cm), which is 5 inches below Onlyjayus’ height. A 5-inch difference in height is quite a lot and can be easily noticed when the two young women stand beside each other.</p><p>Nevertheless, since Summer is above average, going by the by the CDC report, we can not categorize her among short YouTubers.</p><h3><strong>Comparing&nbsp;</strong><strong>Onlyjayus’s&nbsp;</strong><strong>Height With That of Maddi Bragg</strong></h3><p>Maddi Bragg is a 25 years old YouTuber born in Southern California. She stands 5 feet, 4 inches ( 1.62 m or 162 cm) tall. This puts her in the category of American YouTubers that average in height. However, she cannot be counted among the shortest American YouTubers as there are others that stand below her height.</p><p>At 5” 4′, there is a wide gap of difference between Maddi and Onlyjayus. The latter has a height advantage of 7 inches when compared with the former.</p><h3><strong>Gabbie Hanna Is 6 Inches Shorter than OnlyJayus</strong></h3><p>Gabbie Hanna is an American YouTuber and songwriter known for her singing, comedy, vlogs, and videos on Youtube. She stands 5 feet 5 inches (166 cm or 1.66 m) tall and this means that she narrowly escaped being grouped among American women that are below average by just one inch.</p><p>At 5 feet 5 inches, there is an obvious height difference between Gabbie Hanna and OnlyJayus. Gabbie is 6 inches shorter than OnlyJayus.</p><h2><strong>What is Onlyjayus’ Weight?</strong></h2><p>Onlyjayus has a body weight of 58 kg (128 pounds). Based on her age, height, and weight, she has a Body Mass Index (BMI) score of 17.9 kg/m². This BMI score is below the healthy weight BMI range, which is 18.5 kg/m² to 25 kg/m².</p><p>In addition to her height and weight,&nbsp;Onlyjayus has the following body measurements; 34 inches (bust), 28 inches (waist), and 40 inches (hips). Despite being at a mid-thin weight, the YouTuber still has a stunning body structure. Considering her body measurements, the sizes of her bust, waist, and hips are all perfect and fit her height.</p><p>Owing to the fact that she has an undeniably amazing body, some people have speculated that she might have gone under the knife for cosmetic purposes. But so far, there has been no confirmation that Onlyjayus has had any form of body augmentation surgery. There is also nothing to prove that she has undergone any form of plastic surgery, judging by her old and recent pictures.</p><p>However, we won’t conclude on that until the social media star clears the air herself.</p><h3><strong>How Does Onlyjayus Maintain Her Body</strong></h3><p>Unlike other social media personalities who constantly give updates on their diet plans, Onyjayus has decided to keep mute about that, if she follows any. However, judging by her healthy stature, it is obvious that she eats healthy diet.</p><p>Although she has not shared anything about what she eats to stay in shape, the social media star does not hide her workout routine. It has become a trend for most online personalities to use of their workout routines to entertain their fans on their social media platforms. Onlyjayus is not left out of this trend as she has been spotted showcasing some funny workout on her TikTok and Instagram accounts.</p><p>Being that she is focused on entertaining her viewers, she does not follow a proper workout routine in those videos. This does not negate the fact that she may actually have some sort of a private workout routine that helps her keep fit. If actually she does then we hope she would share it with us soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC0zrBkrZmcoXqqv4yopaWxmpbGtr%2BO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-rose-casey-dead-did-amanda-schull-leave-9-1-1-lone-star.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Rose Casey Dead?
