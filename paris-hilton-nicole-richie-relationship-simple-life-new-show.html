The Simple Life was so popular that it is the origin of the reason why people still care about Paris Hilton. For example, people want to know <a href=#>what kind of mom Paris Hilton is</a>, about <a href=#>her husband's "love child"</a>, and that <a href=#>she talked about giving a baby a spray tan</a>.</p><p>However, after The Simple Life ended, Hilton and her co-star Nicole Richie's relationship took surprising turns. That fact makes it amazing that Hilton and Richie reportedly are set to reunite on TV.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>how dramatic Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie's relationship was</strong> after The Simple Life.

For that reason, there is no doubt that most people wouldn't have understood Richie and Hilton's childhoods, which would have bonded them.</p><p>With that in mind, it makes sense that <strong>Hilton and Richie have been friends since they were kids</strong>. That years-long friendship was on full display when Richie and Hilton starred in The Simple Life during the 2000s.</p><p>Sadly for Hilton, Richie, their fans, and the people in their lives, however, <strong>the former co-stars and friends had a huge falling out</strong>. In May 2024, The U.S. Sun updated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its timeline of Richie and Hilton's relationship</a>, which cites several sources. According to that timeline, <strong>Hilton and Richie's relationship began falling apart in 2005</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/simplelife.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the timeline, Hilton first admitted that she and Richie were no longer friends as part of a 2005 statement she released. However, Hilton wouldn't outline what caused their falling out.</p><p>“It’s no big secret that Nicole and I are no longer friends. Nicole knows what she did, and that’s all I’m ever going to say about it.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/paris-hilton-waving.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Paris Hilton's Fragrances Have Earned Her Company More Than $2 Billion, Here's The Truth About Her Almost Unknown Side-Hustle</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Paris Hilton is constantly underestimated by people who have no idea how successful she is in the business world.</span><p>How much older is Paris Hilton than Nicole Richie, according to Famous Birthdays?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Paris Hilton born?:</p></td><td><p>February 17, 1981</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When was Nicole Richie born?:</p></td><td><p>September 21, 1981</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How much older is Paris Hilton than Nicole Richie?:</p></td><td><p>7 months and 4 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Around the same time, Richie told Today's anchors that she and Hilton "just grew apart".

According to the rumors, Richie showed Hilton's infamous intimate tape during a party. When Hilton found out, she was furious and that led to their longstanding friendship ending if the rumors are right.</p><p>On the bright side, that drama eventually subsided and <strong>Richie and Hilton revealed that they'd made peace</strong>. During this era, neither woman pretended they were best friends, but they spoke affectionately about each other.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tom-cruise-s-relationship-with-his-kids-is-questioned-after-he-finally-is-seen-in-public-with-them.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tom Cruise's Relationship With His Kids Revealed After He Steps Out In Public With Them For The First Time In Years</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tom Cruise was spotted with his adopted children which left fans with questions about how close the movie star is with his kids.</span><p>According to the timeline, E!

I haven't spoken to her in a while technically, but if you really want to get into it, my view of a friendship is somebody that you don't necessarily have to talk to every day, somebody that you can call when you need them and they're just going to be there."</p><p>The timeline also reveals that Hilton talked about how much Richie means to her during a 2019 Watch What Happens Live appearance. "I love Nicole. We were actually texting three days ago because it's our high school reunion, so she was reminding me of the date."</p><p>In 2021, Richie attended Hilton's marriage to Carter Reum where they were pictured reuniting. Then in 2024, it was revealed that Hilton and Richie were making big plans together.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-and-nicole-richie-are-returning-for-a-new-streaming-show>Paris Hilton And Nicole Richie Are Returning For A New Streaming Show</h2><p>In May 2024, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie's social media followers were surprised by a collage. The collage, which featured <strong>photos of Richie and Hilton together when they were young</strong>, was uploaded to both stars' Instagram accounts simultaneously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/paris-hilton-and-nicole-richie-behind-the-scenes-of-the-simple-life.jpg><p>When both former reality TV stars uploaded the collage to their account, their fans didn't know that it seemed to be a harbinger of things to come. After all, Hilton and Richie have been on good terms, so the duo celebrating their history doesn't seem that remarkable.</p><p>However, around the same time the collage appeared on Instagram, TMZ published a bombshell report. According to that article, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Richie and Hilton were preparing to star in a new show together</a></strong> decades after The Simple Life ended.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-13.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nicole Richie Was "Given" To Dad Lionel Richie At Age 3, But Her Biological Dad Is Still In The Picture</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nicole Richie has made amends with her biological parents over the years, but that does not mean she has a close relationship with both.</span><p>According to TMZ, <strong>Hilton and Richie's planned new reality show had already been greenlit</strong> by the time the world learned about it.
