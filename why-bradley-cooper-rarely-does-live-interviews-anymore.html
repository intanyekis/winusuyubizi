Bradley Cooper faced the other side of it - he went through hard times prior to his fame.</p><p>Cooper recalls his addiction taking over, at that point he was extremely lost and without a sense of direction. Cooper was able to get everything back on track prior to his breakout with The Hangover. In truth, just before, getting cast wasn't easy, Bradley revealed that for several roles he was deemed not good-looking enough.</p><p>Nonetheless, <a href=#>he made things work at the right time</a>, "I got to go through all of those things before fame even played into my existence on a daily level," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Who Is Gloria Campano, Bradley Cooper's Mom?</a></span></p><p>During his sober journey, Cooper has done his best to help a boatload of A-list actors that dealt with the same addiction issues.

Given his status, Bradley Cooper didn't need to take immense risks with his career. However, he decided to do exactly what with A Star Is Born.</p><p>This was a classic example of the actor deciding to do things his way. In truth, he was steered in the opposite direction, <a href=#>with a lot of his support system telling him not to do the film.</a></p><p>“People I care about, who care about me, told me not to direct ‘A Star Is Born’, said that it would be too difficult and I should start with something easier. Luckily, I didn’t listen.”</p><p>“I loved that it was really, really hard to make this film. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have the same value. And that’s always been my goal: to make something, no matter how challenging, that will be remembered.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Bradley Cooper 'Devastated' Lady Gaga While Filming ‘A Star Is Born’</a></span></p><p>We all know what happens next - the film won several honors at the Academy Awards and in addition, it scored huge numbers at the box office, bringing in $436 million.

However, these days, it is believed that the actor is a lot more careful with the interviews he agrees to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Stars Insider, the feeling for Cooper is that the more he gives away about her personal life, <a href=#>the less intrigued fans become with his on-screen characters</a>. That may hold true, as some of Hollywood's elite like Leonardo DiCaprio rarely speak about their personal life and always bring their A-game during big-screen projects.</p><p>Stars Insider stated, "Bradley Cooper wants fans to buy into his characters, not his personal life. According to him, he gives far too many interviews. He feels the more they know about him, the less they know about the character."</p><p>A fair point of view and one we can understand.
