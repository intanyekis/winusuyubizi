With every coming year, he seems to dedicate himself more ferociously to his profession.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=yes-cheyenne-jackson-gay></span>Yes, Cheyenne Jackson Gay<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On multiple occasions, Cheyenne has fearlessly said that he is gay. The actor is in a committed relationship with his partner Jason Landau. Despite being a gay couple, they have broken the stereotypes and raised children independently.</p><p>Cheyenne’s truthfulness towards his sexual orientation is seen as inspiring as people who look up to him get the strength to embrace sexuality of their own. In that regard, he is almost a role model.</p><p>The actor began his career a long time ago, and after establishing a stronghold in the industry, he hasn’t looked back. Moreover, he has a versatile talent that helps his case to continue being stellar in the industry. His singing abilities have also come to great use because he has been flaunting his sweet voice all his career.</p><p>The official start of his professional career came back in 2002. It has been more than two decades since he started his journey as a professional, and despite the time, he continues to be a star in his own right. As he is still relatively young, there is a remote possibility that we are yet to see the best versions of him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-cheyennes-partner-jason-landau></span>Meet Cheyenne’s Partner Jason Landau<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>American actor Cheyenne has had a lovely relationship with his partner Jason Landau.

Without wasting any time, he decided to marry Jason. The couple tied their knot the very next year in 2014. It has been more than eight years since they got married, but their relationship is still going strong, and they hope to continue being in love with each other until the end of their lives.</p><p>The two make constant appearances in the media together.
