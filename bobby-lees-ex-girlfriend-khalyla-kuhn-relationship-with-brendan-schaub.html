In addition to appearing in front of the camera, Lee is also a successful podcaster. He is best known for co-hosting Bad Friends with actor and comedian Andrew Santino and TigerBelly with Khalyla Khun.</p><p>Bobby Lee and Khalyla Khun had been dating for over ten years before they stunned fans by calling it quits. Despite the apparent end of their romantic relationship, they continued with their podcast. However, while the ex-couple tried to move on with their personal and professional lives, people still wanted to know why they had broken up. Soon, cheating allegations and other shocking things about their relationship began to be exposed in the media. Perhaps the most surprising part was that the breakup was partly due to a situation with Bobby Lee's friend, mixed martial artist and podcast host Brendan Schaub.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-bobby-lee-and-khalyla-kuhn-meet-and-start-their-podcast-tigerbelly>How Did Bobby Lee And Khalyla Kuhn Meet And Start Their Podcast TigerBelly?</h2><p>Bobby Lee and Khalyla Kuhn have a colorful history together.

However, the real reason they chose to do a podcast together had little to do with that.</p><p>Initially, Lee was supposed to do a podcast with comedian Erik Griffin, but the duo never met to discuss plans further because of a scheduling conflict.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bobby-lee-at-the-premiere-of-it-ends-in-la.jpg><p>At the same time, Lee's podcast plans failed, Khalyla was recuperating after experiencing a significant health struggle.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a report by Distractify</a>, Bobby Lee stated on their podcast that they learned Kuhn had a coronary heart condition during a vacation to the Philippines. Lee then recounted how he had to carry her into a taxi after she had an attack, and how they rushed her to the hospital.</p><p>He added that after that, the ambulance frequented their home at least two to three times a week, and she was often in and out of the hospital. Khalyla said that it was during one of her hospital stays, that she came up with the idea to do a podcast with Lee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/what-bobby-lee-s-ex-wife-khalyla-kuhn-really-thinks-of-brendan-schaub_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Odd Reason Why Fans Think Khalyla Kuhn Used Bobby Lee For Fame</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Some details of Khalyla Kuhn's past, and her own words, have fans thinking she wasn't with Bobby Lee for the right reasons.</span><p>In the TigerBelly podcast, Kuhn and Bobby Lee discuss racism, politics, and entertainment within the Asian American community.

The trio were so close that Brendan Schaub said on his show that he considered Lee one of his best friends. Despite their friendship and friendly banter on air, fans couldn't help but notice how flirty Schaub was whenever he spoke to Kuhn.</p><p>The infamous <a href=#>feud between Lee, Kuhn, and Schaub</a> started after defamatory claims were made against the former MMA fighter on Kuhn's other podcast, Trash Tuesday. The episode began when one of the podcast's co-hosts, Annie Lederman, detailed an explicit and troubling experience she had with a male comedian she called B.S.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bobby-lee.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kuhn then shared her experience with the same comedian, who she claimed had often flirted with her. Khalyla Khun then alleged that B.S. had once sent her an inappropriate text message while she was having a celebratory dinner with her family. In the text, the comedian is supposed to have also asked her if she had any additional plans that evening.</p><p>It was easy for fans to discover that B.S. meant Brendan Schaub. At the time of the supposed flirting and inappropriate text messages, Kuhn was still in a relationship with Lee, and this all happened apparently without his knowledge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Bobby Lee being the apparent victim of Schaub's alleged betrayal, it was Lee who Schaub decided to take his anger on after Kuhn outed his behavior. Brendan Schaub accused Bobby Lee of orchestrating a coo against him on Reddit to tarnish his name and have him removed from his podcast, which Lee later vehemently denied.</p><p>After several accusations were made from each side, the trio eventually hashed things out on the TigerBelly podcast.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Bobby Lee's Ex-Girlfriend Khalyla Kuhn Really Thinks Of Brendan Schaub?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Khalyla Kuhn has gotten heat since breaking things off with Bobby Lee after the two exposed Brendan Schaub.</span><p>The entire episode centered on Bobby Lee and Brendan Schaub defending themselves while Khalyla was caught awkwardly in the middle.
