This is the case for the famous rock star Mick Jagger, who has had his eight children with five different women over the decades. But that doesn't mean he isn't proud of every single one of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jagger&nbsp;doesn't seem to want to stop having kids though,&nbsp;because at 76 he still has a child in diapers. His small army of kids&nbsp;love him and support him even as he's still taking the stage with the Rolling Stones.</p><p>Some of his children are almost as famous as him now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">following in his footsteps</a>, just like other rock stars children like <a href=#>Steven Tyler's daughter Liv Tyler</a>, <a href=#>Lenny Kravitz's daughter Zoe Kravitz </a>and David Bowie's son Duncan Jones.</p><p>But who are his children?</p><h2 id=jagger-s-first-daughter-is-karis-hunt-jagger-and-he-had-a-second-with-another-actress>Jagger's First Daughter Is Karis Hunt Jagger And He Had A Second With Another Actress</h2><p>Karis Hunt Jagger was born in 1970 to Jagger and actress/singer Marsha Hunt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The New Daily</a>, Jagger actually tried to deny his paternity just so he wouldn't have to pay child support, but since then Karis and Jagger have formed a good relationship.</p><p>Karis was able to go to Yale and earn her degree in modern history. She has acted in the past but her main profession is volunteering as a teacher and philanthropy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She married actor Jonathan Watson in 2000, and they have two children, Zak and Mazie.</p><p>Jagger married the glamorous actress, Bianca Jagger, in 1971, and that same year they welcomed their only daughter, Jade Jagger. With a mother who rode into her 30th birthday party at Studio 54 on a white horse and a father like Jagger, Jade had an interesting childhood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Big Concert Is Coming! Priyanka Chopra, Mick Jagger And Will Smith Are Just A Few Of The Big Names Participating&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>Her babysitter was Andy Warhol, and she constantly moved around with her parents, who were only married for seven years. So of course all of these influences spurred her into&nbsp;a creative career.</p><p>Jewelry making is Jade's specialty, and in 1996 she founded her company, Jade Inc, which makes pieces that are not cheap. One of them, the 'Jagger Dagger', is an 18-carat white gold sword.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also oversees a lifestyle brand called Jezebel (her middle name) and was the creative director for a luxury home development in India.</p><p>She has three children, Amba, Assisi, and Ray, who was born the same week as his sister, Assisi's daughter Ezra.</p><p>And then came actress/model Jerry Hall...</p><p>In 1984, Jagger and his long-time partner, actress/model, Jerry Hall, welcomed their first child, Elizabeth 'Lizzy' Jagger. Lizzy followed in the footsteps of her mother rather than her father though.</p><p>She walked in Chanel's runway at the early age of five and continued her career as a model with the company along with others like Tommy Hilfiger, Lancome, and Gap.</p><p>Lizzy is also very passionate about activism and in 2018 she successfully lobbied for the Equal Rights Amendment to pass in Illinois.</p><h2 id=jagger-has-his-first-son>&nbsp;Jagger Has His First Son.</h2><p>The next year, Jagger and Hall had their first son, James Jagger, who later took traits from each of his parents as a musician/actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Gigi Hadid And Zayn Are The New Mick Jagger And Jerry Hall&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>The only one of Jagger's children to pursue a career in music, James started a punk band called Turbogeist.</p><p>James and his father got to work together though in HBO's show Vinyl, where Jagger was executive producer and James played one of the rockstars in the 70's-set New York drama. After one season it was canceled.</p><p>He married his wife Anoushka Sharma in 2015.</p><h2 id=hall-gives-birth-to-their-third-child>Hall Gives Birth To Their Third Child</h2><p>In 1992, Jagger and Hall had Georgia May Jagger, who also followed in the footsteps of her mother. If you've seen any makeup commercials or fashion ads, you've probably seen Georgia's picture.</p><p>Like her sister, Lizzy, she's walked for Chanel and Tommy Hilfiger, as well as Versace, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, and Marc Jacobs.</p><p>Georgia signed with Rimmel in 2009 and walked with Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell in the 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony, representing fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jagger-has-his-second-son>Jagger Has His Second Son.</h2><p>Hall and Jagger's second son, Gabriel Jagger was born in 1997. He has also become a model after his sister Jade convinced him to model for a magazine.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What John Lennon's Kids Are Up To Today</a></span></p><p>His career is still young, but&nbsp;while he dabbles in modeling he also dabbles in journalism. He had an internship at The Times and has a website called Why Now.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He's reportedly engaged to&nbsp;Swiss girlfriend, Anouk Winzenried.</a></p><p>With ex-girlfriend, Luciana Gimenez, Jagger had his son, Lucas Jagger, in 1999, while he was still with Hall. When Hall left him when the pregnancy was revealed, Jagger demanded a paternity test.</p><p>After all of that drama, Jagger was able to establish a relationship with his second youngest child, and they are often seen together enjoying football matches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jagger-might-not-be-done-having-children>Jagger Might Not Be Done Having Children</h2><p>In 2016, Jagger and his girlfriend, ballerina, Melanie Hamrick, welcomed their son, Deveraux Jagger. Obviously there's not much to tell about the three-year-old, but when he was born his sister Lizzy posted a picture of him, welcoming him to the big family.</p><p>"So proud of my beautiful baby brother Deveraux Octavian Basil Jagger," Lizzy wrote. Hamrick posted the same picture as well, writing, "I'm so in love with my baby Deveraux Jagger. Thank you @lizzyjagger for the sweet introduction."</p><p>There's no doubt that Jagger's family tree is a little confusing, what with his great-grandchild being born before her great-uncle. But it's clear that all of Jagger's children are successful in their own right, or at least some of them are and the rest will probably follow in time.</p><p>One thing's for sure, Jagger has his hands full. The holidays must be interesting.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Highest Grossing Concert Tours Of All Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecyimqRlmpa0qLHRrGScoJmhsbOxzWg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ben-afflecks-east-coast-style-l-a-mansion-sold-for-28-5-million.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ben Affleck's East Coast-Style L.A Mansion Sold For $28.5 Million</a>
