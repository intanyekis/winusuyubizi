It has become a status symbol and mark of success as it is one of the cars on everyone’s dream list. Many celebrities <a href=#>show great emotion as they buy their first Ferrari</a>, a car that has given a sense of accomplishment to people for many decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While buying a Ferrari is a remarkable feat, it comes with its fair share of strict regulations that owners need to follow to purchase and maintain the car. The Italian supercars have become a lifestyle, and Ferrari ensures that only the right people represent the brand. Even celebrities are not exempted from this rule by the automaker. Ferrari picks its clients carefully, and while many make the cut, some break the rules that get them banned from owning the car. Let’s look at the celebrities who are forbidden from buying a Ferrari.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Justin Bieber</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most recent celebrities who Ferrari has banned is Justin Bieber. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The singer purchased his second Ferrari in 2011</a>, a 458 Italia in white, which he took to West Coast Customs. Bieber changed the color to electric blue, modified the wheels, and added custom lug nuts. He was also negligent with his maintenance as he forgot where he parked the car, and it took his assistant three weeks to locate it. Later, he auctioned it off for $434,500 within a year of purchasing it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Times Justin Bieber Showed He Has Serious Anger Issues</a></span></p><h2 id=tyga><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tyga</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Rappers like to flaunt their wealth</a> by purchasing expensive cars, and Tyga is no different. He first came into the spotlight for his highly publicized relationship with Kylie Jenner, but the pair ended their relationship in 2017. Tyga loves supercars, and he often leases the cars so he can repay the amount over time. However, many of his purchases were repossessed due to failure of repayment. His 2012 Ferrari 458 Spider was one of them, and the automaker sued him in response.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kim Kardashian</span></h2><p>There is no known reason why Kim Kardashian has been blacklisted by Ferrari for many years now. Kardashian was spotted riding a Ferrari in 2012, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it is unclear whether it was her private purchase or a gift from Kanye West</a>. Reportedly, she cannot purchase certain models from Ferrari, including any exclusive editions, as the automaker reserves the right to decide who can own them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian And 9 Other Celebs That Have Frozen Their Eggs For Future Fertility</a></span></p><h2 id=floyd-mayweather-jr><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Floyd Mayweather Jr.</span></h2><p>Ferrari has been quite strict about its ownership agreement, wherein the owner is expected to keep and maintain the car for more than a year. It doesn’t allow the sale, even if the person is one of the best defensive boxing players. Mayweather is known to flaunt his wealth and buy expensive jewels and automobiles. He also resells cars within a few months and shares them on his social media, which does not comply with the rules of Ferrari.</p><h2 id=blac-chyna><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Blac Chyna</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blac Chyna has made her wealth due to her highly publicized relationships and being an influencer on social media. While she needs to constantly splurge her net worth on buying expensive things to stay in the headlines, she pulled off a stunt after purchasing two custom Ferrari cars: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Ferrari California in bright pink and a Ferrari 488 with red wheels</a>. As she used the vehicles for attention, she was banned from buying another Ferrari from any car dealership.</p><h2 id=nicolas-cage><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nicolas Cage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Nicolas Cage was once one of the highest-paid actors</a> and had a $150 million fortune from his iconic movie roles. He spent his fortune buying expensive cars, including a $1 million Ferrari Enzo. Due to his overspending, he went bankrupt and sold many possessions, including his vehicles. His many Ferraris were auctioned off, which created a bad image for the automaker, who then banned him from making any purchases in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nicolas Cage's Top 10 Movies, Ranked By Box Office Gross</a></span></p><h2 id=deadmau5><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Deadmau5</span></h2><p>EDM Artist Deadmau5 was famously banned from Ferrari for his extreme modifications to his Ferrari 458 Italia. He paid tribute to the Nyan Cat internet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meme from the early 2000s and used that as a theme for his car livery</a>. He showed off the car at various auto shows and drove it in public, which displeased the automaker. Deadmau5 was sent a cease-and-desist letter, and after a few legal actions, he sold the car to a different owner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=50-cent><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>50 Cent</span></h2><p>50 Cent has always been vocal on social media when sharing his opinions. 50 Cent, who owns a Ferrari 488, ranted on Instagram to voice his frustration when his Ferrari had a dead battery and was towed away for repair. He called the car an ‘F—ing Lemon,’ which did not please the PR Department for the automaker, and it is safe to say that the rapper won’t be able to own another Ferrari for a long time.</p><p>Other notable celebrities banned from owning a Ferrari include Preston Henn, Chris Harris, and David Lee. Ferrari has a long-standing reputation for being picky with its users and maintaining its brand image by selling cars to the right customers. Despite the challenges that come with owning a Ferrari, celebrities still waitlist themselves to get the vehicle from one of the most exclusive automakers in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: Auto Evolution, Paper Magazine, Hot Cars, Motor Biscuit</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvZpuVobKjvsitoJ6rXay1sHnAq5xmmpGju6awjJ%2BpqKVdl8K6tc2gZJ%2Bdoqeus7XSaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rydel-funk-married-capron-funk.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Rydel Funk Still Married to Capron Funk?
