Joseph was a talented musician who decided to pursue music at an early age.<p id=content-paragraph-30>“I decided I wanted to do music from I was 11. Me and my cousin Daniel began to make beats with MPCs (MIDI Production Center or Music Production Controller) but I wouldn’t save them properly,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jamaica Observer</a> in 2014. “Then when I was around 12, my cousins and I went on the Melody Makers’ Roots Rock tour. Uncle Ziggy bought my cousins an Apple laptop and we used the Garage Band software and made our beats on it. We recorded from the microphone, put on our headphones and that became our studio for a good three years. That is when my songwriting started to get more focused.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>Joseph released two EPs during his music career: Comfortable in 2014 and Eternal in 2021.

The eldest grandchild of Bob and Rita Marley was with two other Black colleagues and a white assistant when they were surrounded by seven police cars. “When I was ordered to put my hands up I looked at one of the policemen and said are you serious? From the first few minutes, they knew that they were wrong but there is no protocol to deescalate the situation,” she explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-37>“They never drew weapons and at no moment was I afraid; I just felt sorry for them because they looked like robots repeating protocol. The police got a call about a potential burglary in process and they sent seven vehicles, a helicopter and not one black officer but they knew it was three black people there,” she further recalled. “What did they expect would happen? We have to revise this protocol because it has resulted in many destructive ends; I am sure that one of the reasons why the police were so well behaved in this case is because of who I am.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GomWalkae5psWMpKCdq11pg3OFmGxsaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mona-scott-young-bio-age-husand-blurred-lines-joseline.html>&#171;&nbsp;Mona Scott-Young Bio, Age, Husand, Blurred Lines, Joseline</a>
