Momoa</a>. Their relationship made headlines after multiple sources confirmed that the two are dating. This was the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first time Jason Momoa entered into a relationship</a> following his split with Lisa Bonet. The two reportedly just started out as friends, which eventually led into something more profound. Eiza Gonzalez’s most prominent role in Hollywood is her stint in the film Baby Driver playing as Darling. She is a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">significant and phenomenal star</a> in Mexico City before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in Hollywood; take a look at her history in the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Gypsy King: Here's How Jason Momoa Made It Big In Hollywood</a></span></p><h2 id=eiza-gonzalez-s-early-life-that-influenced-her-career>Eiza Gonzalez’s Early Life That Influenced Her Career</h2><p>https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/323485185742784113/</p><p>Eiza González Reyna was born on January 30, 1990, in Mexico City, Mexico. She is the daughter of her mother, Glenda Reyna, who used to be a model and her father, Carlos Gonzales. She has one brother named Yulen, who is twelve years older than her. Her father died when she was only twelve years old because of a motorcycle accident. She has stated in one of her interviews that her father's death has become a strong influence in her career.</p><p>Gonzalez attended the Edron Academy and then transferred to the American School Foundation, both located in Mexico City. Both of these schools are private bi-lingual schools. At 14, she <a href=#>enrolled at a famed acting school </a>in Televisa named Centro de Educación Artística where she finished two years out of the three year course. While she was attending the school, she was spotted by a producer and director named Pedro Damian who is best known for his success with the RBD Latin pop band. However, she decided to stop attending school when she was cast as the lead character in the teen-oriented telenovela titled Lola...Érase Una vez at the age of 16 in 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=entering-the-world-of-entertainment>Entering The World of Entertainment</h2><p>https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/129478558026813095/</p><p>After two years of attending school, Pedro Damian decided to cast her again in the remake of the famous children's telenovela of Argentina titled Floricienta. She portrayed the role of the lead female protagonist named Lola Valente in the Mexican version. Gonzalez finally made her debut in the TV screen playing as Lola in Lola...Érase una vez. This has jumpstarted her acting career in Mexico. The telenovela was shown in various countries outside Mexico <a href=#>throughout the Latin America </a>and the United States. She decided she needs to improve her acting skills and decided to study acting at the acting school in Mexico City which is run by the famed actress named Patricia Reyes Spíndola, M&M Studio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after they have finished filming for the Lola, érase una vez, Gonzalez’s mom decided for them to move to New York City for a short time in the spring of 2008 for Gonzalez to attend a three-month course of acting classes at the famed Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. She returned to Mexico after a year of staying in New York. When she returned to Mexico, she was cast in one of the crime drama television series episodes titled Mujeres Asesinas as one of the supporting roles for the second season of the series.</p><h2 id=rising-into-stardom-and-hollywood-career>Rising Into Stardom And Hollywood Career</h2><p>https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/16395986136309819/</p><p>After studying in New York City, her projects started pouring in. She then starred with Mexican actress Susana González in the episode titled Tere, Desconfiada. She then released her first solo album titled Contracorriente soon after. In 2010, Nickelodeon announced that she will be starring in the teen series titled Sueña Conmigo, where she played two characters, Clara Molina and Roxy. In order to film for the series, she<a href=#> traveled to the capital of Argentine Republic</a> to Buenos Aires in April 2010 and lived there for a year and only traveled back to Mexico City during filming breaks of the series. When the filming ended, she finally returned to Mexico City for good. The show was aired throughout Latin America and Europe. With the show's huge success in Argentina, the casts went on to tour in several cities in the country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She finally had her acting debut in the big screen starring in the comedy-drama directed by Alejandro Sugich titled Casi 30. She went on to star in different films until she decided to move to Los Angeles in August 2013 to pursue an acting career in Hollywood. She was eventually cast in the film titled All Hail the Squash Blossom Queen by Adrian Cervantes in September 2013. She was supposed to star alongside Bonnie Wright of Harry Potter; unfortunately she was dropped from the project after the role was recast in 2015. She went back and forth from LA to Mexico since she is constantly offered projects in Mexico. This might seem like a setback in her Hollywood career, but she patiently waited for her turn to make a name for herself and she eventually did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the course of her stay in LA, she has landed some prominent roles in big Hollywood projects.
